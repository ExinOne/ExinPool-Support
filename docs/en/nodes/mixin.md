## Queue and Revenue

### Queue Benefits
**Q**: Is there any revenue during queuing?  
**A**: Yes, queued XIN provides several benefits:
1. Generates asset points
2. Asset points can be used for:
   - ExinOne's lending service (no additional collateral needed)

   - EPC can offset service fees for:
     - C2C transactions
     - Exchange operations
     - Fixed investments
     - Other ExinOne services

### Queue Status
**Q**: Why am I showing "in the queue"?  
**A**: This is a normal process:
- Mainnet joining takes time
- Once confirmed, status changes from 'Joined but not inactive' to 'Joined and active'
- Revenue distribution begins after snapshot

### Revenue Start Time
**Q**: When will I start to earn after joining the node?  
**A**: Revenue generation process:
1. Successful queue join
2. Wait for node to join mainnet (1-2 days)
3. Node starts earning revenue
4. Your queued XINs begin generating revenue

## Costs and Distribution

### Exit Costs
**Q**: How much does it cost for a node to exit?  
**A**: 
- ExinPool exit fee: 0.2%
- Supports EPC deduction (possible fee-free exit)
- Note: The 1% fee mentioned in robot introduction refers to early mainnet exit, different from ExinPool exit

### Revenue Distribution
**Q**: When will the node revenue be paid?  
**A**: Daily distribution schedule:
- 8:00 AM Beijing time: Daily snapshot
- After 15:00: Mainnet node revenue issued
- Before 24:00: Normal distribution window
- Changes will be announced if schedule varies

### Payment Method
**Q**: Where will the node revenue be paid?  
**A**: All payments are made to Mixin wallet

### Reinvestment
**Q**: Are the revenue automatically reinvested?  
**A**: No, revenue is paid out daily. Manual reinvestment required.

## Revenue Variations

### Revenue Changes
**Q**: Why does revenue change?  
**A**: Several factors affect revenue:
1. **Mainnet Mechanism**
   - Work-based distribution
   - Daily revenue fluctuations
   
2. **Node Changes**
   - Continuous node joins/exits
   - Varying node numbers
   - Revenue adjusts accordingly

3. **ExinPool Service**
   - Revenue distributed proportionally
   - New nodes may receive less initially due to mainnet joining time
