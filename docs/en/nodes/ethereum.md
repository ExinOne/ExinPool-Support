## eETH and Revenue

### eETH Description
**Q**: What is eETH?  
**A**: In "When will the node revenue be paid", it is mentioned that the revenue will be distributed using eETH. The relationship between eETH and ETH is 1:1. Currently, Mixin Wallet can view the price, which is the same as ETH. At present, the Shanghai upgrade has been completed, and eETH can be exchanged for ETH or other currencies at @7000101276, and the revenue of ETH nodes will continue to be distributed in eETH in the future.

### Revenue Payment
**Q**: Where will the node revenue be paid?  
**A**: Uniformly paid to Mixin wallet.

### Reinvestment
**Q**: Are the revenue automatically reinvested?  
**A**: No, although ETH and eETH have the same value, they are two different coins in the Mixin Network, and the received eETH does not support reinvestment to the ETH node. If you want to reinvest, you need to queue up with ETH, and you will only get revenue after joining successfully. If you want to reinvest, you can convert eETH to ETH at @7000101276 and queue up to join.

## Additional Information

### Revenue Variability
**Q**: Why does the node revenue keep changing every week?  
**A**: There are the following reasons for the change of node revenue. First, the number of Ethereum 2.0 nodes is constantly changing, and the revenue is also changing; second, Ethereum 2.0 nodes currently has MEV Boost enabled, and the revenue is also changing.
