title: ExinPool Reserve Fund Plan
---


## Introduction

In the world of digital assets, **time is money**. We understand that waiting to join or exit a node in the staking process could mean missing out on valuable opportunities. Therefore, to greatly enhance your staking experience, ExinPool has specially introduced the "Reserve Fund Plan" for **SOL** and **DOT**.

## Why the Reserve Fund Plan?

ExinPool guarantees that all node assets are **100% staked on-chain**, ensuring asset security and transparency. However, this also means that joining or exiting a node requires a certain processing time:

| Token | Join Time | Exit Time |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| DOT   | ~2 days   | Up to 21 days |
| SOL   | ~3 days   | ~3 days |

> Although this is a common aspect of blockchain technology, we believe we can offer you a better experience.

## How Does the Reserve Fund Plan Work?

To optimize your experience with joining and exiting ExinPool nodes, we have launched the Reserve Fund Plan. The core of this plan is to use ExinPool's own SOL and DOT as immediately available reserve funds.

### Key Features

1. **Accelerated Joining**
   - When you're in the queue to join a node
   - If ExinPool has sufficient reserve funds within the node
   - These funds will be prioritized for withdrawal
   - Allows you to join swiftly
   - Significantly reduces wait times

2. **Quick Exit**
   - When you're in the queue to exit a node
   - We use reserve funds to take your place
   - Enables immediate completion of exit
   - Bypasses standard waiting period

### Benefits

- ✅ Enhanced convenience in joining/exiting nodes
- ✅ Maintains all benefits of on-chain staking
- ✅ High earnings potential
- ✅ Complete transparency
- ✅ More flexible asset management
- ✅ Improved efficiency

## Important Notes
